freqs_schema.sql is sqlite based table for frequency list.

sudo su - postgres
psql -d cart

load pipe delimited data:

copy freqs (freq, label, bank, source) from '/home/pub/rtl_fm-scanner/data/freqs_dump.txt' with delimiter '|';

Steps towards grouping:

select * from freqs left outer join xmit_history on freqs.freq_key = xmit_history.freq_key;

select label, count(xmit_key) from freqs left outer join xmit_history on freqs.freq_key = xmit_history.freq_key group by label;

select freqs.freq_key, label, count(xmit_key) from freqs left outer join xmit_history on freqs.freq_key = xmit_history.freq_key group by freqs.freq_key, freqs.label;

select freqs.freq_key, label, count(xmit_key) from freqs left outer join xmit_history on freqs.freq_key = xmit_history.freq_key where bank = 'ATC' group by freqs.freq_key, freqs.label;

select freqs.freq_key, freq, label, bank, pass, count(xmit_key) from freqs left outer join xmit_history on freqs.freq_key = xmit_history.freq_key where bank = 'ATC' group by freqs.freq_key, freqs.label;

What has been happening over the weekend:

select freq, label, bank, pass, count(xmit_key) from freqs left outer join xmit_history on freqs.freq_key = xmit_history.freq_key where bank in ('RAMERICA', 'ELKHART', 'ALMS') and xmit_history.entered > (current_date - interval '3 days') group by freqs.freq_key, freqs.label order by freq asc;

Show the typical frequencies for RA IMSA:

select freq, label from freqs where bank='ALMS' or bank='RAMERICA' order by freq asc;

# the next section with the regex stuff was moved into trans_browse

Working on finding duplicate transmissions.   This happens when signal bleeds over to other freqs:

select file, substring(file,9,10), duration, entered  as stamp from xmit_history order by stamp desc limit 10;

# this does the right thing with variable size frequencies
select file, (regexp_matches(file, '^[0-9.]+'))[1] as freq, substring(file,9,10) as timestamp from xmit_history  limit 10;

cart=# select file, (regexp_matches(file, '^[0-9.]+'))[1]::numeric as freq, (regexp_matches(file, '_([0-9]+).wav'))[1] as timestamp from xmit_history  limit 10;

# end of section playing around with regex

# activity during a session:
select freq, label, bank, pass, count(xmit_key) from freqs left outer join xmit_history on freqs.freq_key = xmit_history.freq_key where bank in ('RAMERICA', 'ELKHART', 'ALMS') and xmit_history.entered >= timestamp '2018-08-05 14:00' and xmit_history.entered <= timestamp '2018-08-05 16:00' group by freqs.freq_key, freqs.label order by freq asc;
