rtl_fm-scanner
==============
This is a websocket interface to rtl_fm (part of RTL-SDR).

Dependencies
------------

* A version of rtl_fm that outputs frequency when squelch opens.  At time of creating this rtl_fm-scanner this capability did not exist in stock version.
* Mojolicious
* aplay (part of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture).

Note
----
In its current state rtl-fm_scanner is not intended for general use.  In fact it may never reach that point.
